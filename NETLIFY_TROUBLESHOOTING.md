# Netlify Build Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔧 **Current Issue: npm build error**

The build is failing during the npm install or build process. Here are multiple solutions:

## 🚀 **Solution 1: Updated Configuration (Try First)**

I've removed the `packageManager` field that was forcing pnpm usage. This should fix the conflict.

**Files updated:**
- ✅ `frontend/package.json` - Removed pnpm packageManager
- ✅ `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml` - Deleted to avoid conflicts

## 🛠️ **Solution 2: Alternative Build Command**

If the current build still fails, try this in Netlify settings:

**Build command:**
```bash
cd frontend && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build
```

**Publish directory:** `frontend/dist`

## 🔄 **Solution 3: Manual Netlify Settings**

Go to your Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Build & deploy:

1. **Build command:** `cd frontend && npm install --force && npm run build`
2. **Publish directory:** `frontend/dist`
3. **Node version:** `18`
4. **Environment variables:** Add `NPM_FLAGS=--legacy-peer-deps`

## 📦 **Solution 4: Pre-built Deployment**

If builds keep failing, you can deploy a pre-built version:

1. **Download the repo locally**
2. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Upload the `frontend/dist` folder** directly to Netlify
4. **Set redirects manually** in Netlify dashboard

## 🎯 **Solution 5: Simplified Build**

I've created `netlify-alternative.toml` with more robust build settings. To use it:

1. **Rename current file:** `netlify.toml` → `netlify-backup.toml`
2. **Rename alternative:** `netlify-alternative.toml` → `netlify.toml`
3. **Redeploy**

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Dependency Conflicts**
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Clear node_modules before install
- Use npm instead of pnpm

### **React 19 Compatibility**
- Some packages may not support React 19 yet
- The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag helps with this

### **Build Memory Issues**
- Netlify has build memory limits
- The simplified config should help

## 🎉 **Expected Success**

When working, you should see:
```
✓ Dependencies installed
✓ Vite build completed
✓ Build artifacts created in frontend/dist
✓ Site deployed successfully
```

## 🆘 **If All Else Fails**

I can create a simplified version with fewer dependencies that's guaranteed to build. Let me know if you need this option!

The Resume Optimizer will work perfectly once we get past this build issue! 🚀
